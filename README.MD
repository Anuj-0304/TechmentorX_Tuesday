Porblem Statement:
AgriTech Web Platform
Farmers and agricultural stakeholders do not have a single digital platform that provides reliable, 
data-driven tools for crop management, market price analysis, and resource planning.
Most existing farming processes are manual, slow, and inefficient, which leads to lower crop yields and unstable income.

To solve this problem,
a centralized AgriTech web application is needed that can deliver real-time data,
smart farming recommendations, and decision-support features to help users make better,
faster, and more sustainable agricultural decisions.

Mainly solves the problem of youth farmers and revolutionize the agriculture sector.
