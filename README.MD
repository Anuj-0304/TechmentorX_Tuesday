Porblem Statement:
AgriTech Web Platform
Farmers and agri-stakeholders lack easy access to reliable, data-driven tools
for crop management, market insights, and resource optimization. Traditional
methods are manual, time-consuming, and inefficient, leading to lower
productivity and income uncertainty. There is a need for a centralized
AgriTech website that provides smart farming insights, real-time information,
and decision support to improve agricultural efficiency and sustainability.
